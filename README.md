# `did-duke-win`

The usage of the shell script found in this project is:

`did-duke-win [test-url]`

Running the command with an option of `--help` will display its usage.

Running the command without the optional `[test-url]` will scrape <https://diddukewin.com> to determine the outcome of Duke's last basketball game. In the case of a win, the command will print "Yes.", and in the case of a loss it will print "No!" No other output is expected and no new files will be left on the system upon completion of the script.

If a `[test-url]` is provided, then the script will check it instead. To links you can test the script with from Internet Archive are:

Win: <http://web.archive.org/web/20190130054918/http://www.diddukewin.com/>

Loss: <http://web.archive.org/web/20190401020725/https://www.diddukewin.com/>
